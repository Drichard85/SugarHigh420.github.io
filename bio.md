## Even more about me...
---


>>> 8. I was born and raised in Upstate New York. I have never been out of the US until I moved here in October. I have been in Iwakuni for almost 7 months now and I absolutely love it. However, I am adjusting to the food. I love my transfats and processed foods. I'm married and have a 16 year old son. My husband and son like it here as well and they both actually really enjoy the food because they are partial to ramen. I am currently enrolled in [UMUC](https://campus.umuc.edu/) and my favorite class is IFSM 201. I plan on gettong my bachelor's degree in Accounting. The more I learn in IFSM 201, the more I think about changing my major to something more computer centric. I've taken the liberty of writing up a little blurb about computer technology on the next page. Click the IFSM link below and enjoy!
